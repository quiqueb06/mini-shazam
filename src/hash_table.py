class HashTable:
    """
    Hash table using separate chaining.

    Each bucket is a Python list of (key, value) pairs.
    When multiple entries hash to the same bucket, they form a "chain."

    You will implement:
      - _hash(key)       : Map an integer key to a bucket index
      - insert(key, value): Add a (key, value) pair to the table
      - lookup(key)       : Retrieve all values associated with a key
      - size()            : Return the total number of stored entries
      - capacity()        : Return the number of buckets
      - load_factor()     : Return entries / capacity
      - stats()           : Return collision statistics as a dict
      - _next_prime(n)    : Find the smallest prime >= n
      - _resize()         : Double capacity and rehash all entries

    def _hash(self, key):
        """
        Map an integer key to a bucket index in range [0, capacity).

        Requirements:
          - Must return an integer in [0, self._capacity)
          - Must be deterministic (same key always maps to same index)
          - Should distribute keys uniformly across buckets

        Hint: The Knuth multiplicative hash works well here.
              Multiply the key by a large constant, then take modulo capacity.
              The constant 2654435761 (a prime close to 2^32 * phi) is a
              classic choice from Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming."

        Important: Use int(key) to convert the key to a Python int first.
                   This avoids integer overflow issues with numpy int64 values.

        Args:
            key: An integer hash key

        Insert a (key, value) pair into the hash table.

        Steps:
          1. Compute the bucket index using self._hash(key)
          2. Append the (key, value) tuple to that bucket's list
          3. Increment self._size
          4. Check if load_factor() > 0.75 — if so, call self._resize()

        Note: Duplicate keys ARE allowed. In Shazam, many different songs
        can produce the same fingerprint hash, so the same key may have
        multiple values. This is why each bucket is a list, not a single slot.

        Args:
            key: The hash key (an integer)

          3. Collect all values where the stored key matches the query key
          4. Return the list (empty list if no matches)

        Why return ALL values? In Shazam, the same fingerprint hash can
        appear in multiple songs (or at multiple positions in the same song).
        We need all of them to do proper time-coherent matching later.

        This is used during resizing: we double the capacity and then

        help distribute keys more evenly (especially with modular hashing).

        Algorithm:
          1. If n <= 2, return 2
          2. Start with candidate = n (or n+1 if n is even)
          3. Test if candidate is prime by checking divisibility

        Why is this necessary? As the load factor increases, chains get
        longer and lookups slow down from O(1) toward O(n). Resizing
        keeps chains short.
